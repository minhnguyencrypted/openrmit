# Minh Nguyen (s3877222)'s OpenRMIT repository

OpenRMIT repository is inspired by the idea of Free and Open-Source Sofware (FOSS), where Free means Freedom, not only Free Beer. FOSS allows you to freely view, modify, redistribute, research and do many other things with Softwares' source codes. Source code can be built into binary files to run by yourself, just follow the included instructions of building and cloning the repository.

## Cloning the repository

Using git bash commands on any Linux distros, macOS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minhnguyencrypted/openrmit
```
On Windows, you need to download git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and run the command above.

## Building the source files

I suggest you use the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to build source files, by run the command below
```bash
gcc -o [your_output_file] [source_file]
```
